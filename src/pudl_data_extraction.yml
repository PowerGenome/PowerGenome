# DATA YEAR
# Pick one or more years of generator data to use when creating clusters. If
# more than one year is used then things like heat rate will be calculated as the
# average (weighted by generation per year).

# CLUSTERING
# Existing thermal power plants are clusted to reduce the number of distinct plants.
# The existing method (for now) is to specify the number of clusters for each type
# of thermal plant as a default and then specify specific values for any regions
# that are different.

num_clusters:
  Conventional Steam Coal: 1
  Natural Gas Fired Combined Cycle: 1
  Natural Gas Fired Combustion Turbine: 1
  Nuclear: 1
  Conventional Hydroelectric: 1
  Wood/Wood Waste Biomass: 1
