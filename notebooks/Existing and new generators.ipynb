    "### New generators\n",
    "\n",
    "New generators are based on data from NREL's Annual Technology Baseline (ATB). ATB uses a format of `\\<technology>_<tech_detail>` to describe resources, such as `NaturalGas_CTAvgCF`. There are additional parameters including the cost case and financial case that are needed to specify the capex for a specific generator type. Note that many of the `tech_detail` values have identical capex and O&M values, so it doesn't matter which one is used. Examples include the capacity factor of combustion resources (`CTAvgCF` vs `CTHighCF`) and UtilityPV (`Chicago`, `KansasCity`, and `LosAngeles` have different capacity factors that we don't use in PowerGenome).\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw output from `create_new_generators` has many more columns than existing generators. Several of these - such as `basis_year`, `capex`, `capex_mwh`, `cap_recovery_years`, `waccnomtech`, `regional_cost_multiplier`, and `interconnect_annuity` - are used to calculate the final `Inv_cost_per_MWyr` and `Inv_cost_per_MWhyr`. `lcoe` is pre-calculated using 2030 mid-range ATB costs, and is not specific to the model year for each run. The underlying data are retained here so they can be easily reviewed, but only keep the columns that you want/need.\n",
    "\n",
    "The column `variability` has array values with the annual generation profiles for a resource. If these profiles represent 2012 they have 8784 hourly values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The column `Max_Cap_MW` has a value of -1 if there is no limit on the capacity. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the user has included demand response profiles as an external file (using the `demand_response_fn` parameter in settings and the associated `demand_response` and `demand_response_resources` parameters), demand response resources will be included.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modified and custom new generators\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, new generators are created using data from NREL ATB. But it is possible to modify an existing ATB generator type or create a modified copy of an ATB generator. To understand \n",
    "\n",
    "Modified ATB generators are included in the `atb_modifiers` parameter. In ATB 2019, NREL used a blend of combustion turbine and combined cycle types that we felt was unrealistic. Therefore we have included, by default, the following modifications. The modifying values are provided as `[<op>, <value>]`, where `op` is an operator of type `add`, `mul`, `sub`, and `truediv`. Again, this parameter modifies an existing technology in-place.\n",

    "### Interconnection costs\n",
    "Wind and solar resources have pre-calculated interconnection costs, so the user doesn't need to supply any additional data. But if a spur line is needed for thermal resources, these distances should be included under the column `spur_miles` in the file specified by `capacity_limit_spur_fn`. This spur line distance is then multiplied by costs for each model region listed in the `transmission_investment_cost` parameter. Spur line capex in the example settings file is from ReEDS documentation. You can look at [a mapping of IPM regions to ReEDS regions](https://github.com/gschivley/pg_misc/blob/master/create_clusters/site_interconnection_costs.py#L32-L155) and the associated transmission costs that I have compiled."
