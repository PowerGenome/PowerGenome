# Flexible loads associated with increased electrification can be included using data
# from NREL's EFS study (described below) or using user input files. This case study
# uses EFS data.


# Electrification scenarios are supplied in two files. EFS_STOCK_AGG.parquet has scenarios
# from the NREL Electrification Futures Study (EFS). SCENARIO_STOCK.parquet has scenarios
# from the Princeton Net Zero study. The scenario name will depend on which source you
# use. The NREL EFS scenarios include:

# HIGH ELECTRIFICATION - MODERATE TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT
# MEDIUM ELECTRIFICATION - MODERATE TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT
# REFERENCE ELECTRIFICATION - MODERATE TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT

# The Princeton Net Zero scenarios include:

# current_policy
# stated_policy
# deep_decarbonization
# moderate_decarbonization

# The type of flexible loads that can be included as flexible demand resources (with hourly
# profiles from NREL EFS data) are:

# res_space_heat_cool (residential space heating and cooling)
# res_water_heat (residential water heating)
# comm_space_heat_cool (commercial space heating and cooling)
# comm_water_heat (commercial water heating)
# trans_light_duty (light duty vehicles)
# trans_medium_duty (medium duty vehicles)
# trans_heavy_duty (heavy duty vehicles)
# trans_bus (transit buses)
